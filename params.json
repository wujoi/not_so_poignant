  "tagline": "DISCLAIMER: There are no cartoon foxes, no dark yet whimsical anecdotes about weezards and whatnot, and just forget about it if you're looking for the elf and his pet ham.",
  "body": "### Chapter One: Introduction\r\nIf you are sorely disappointed by the disclaimer above, do not continue reading this guide. Instead, learn Ruby [here](http://poignant.guide/). Otherwise, welcome to my Ruby guide. This guide is not necessarily for you to learn Ruby, but a place for me to store and share the knowledge I gain on my own Ruby journey! I am not a Ruby expert (yet) but hang around and you can learn the language with me! \r\n\r\nRemember your middle school Spanish class? Every Friday, Ms. Jones totters about the room in her too-tight pantsuit, handing out a vocabulary quiz. She stops every couple rows to scrunch up her face in an attempt to keep a pair of oversized spectacles from falling off the bridge of her narrow pinched nose. The girl in the back jumps up a few rows to sit as close as possible to Tommy Jean. Casey, in a deep blue tee with a fire breathing dragon plastered across the front, squirms uneasily and tries to discreetly unlodge something from his left nostril. Kim pops her gum and tosses her hair nonchalantly, pulling out a folded square of paper. Down the hall in gym class, Trisha, who seriously owes Kim and took this same quiz first period, starts sweating profusely (obviously not from the game of dodgeball because she is so not participating). She knows that if a single answer on that paper is wrong, she is so uninvited from Kim's 13th birthday party which would so kill her social reputation, but more importantly would totally destroy her chances with Kim's dreamy older brother Chris. \r\n\r\nAlright, let's make one thing clear right now. This Ruby guide will _not_ be like middle school Spanish. Yes, you will have to learn vocabulary. And no, you cannot cheat off of Tommy Jean. But I am not Ms. Jones; I do not wear pantsuits and I will not take attendance or give you Friday quizzes. If you want to an \"A\" in Ruby, you _will_ need to learn the vocabulary, but you will also need to practice practice practice the writing and reading exercises found [here](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/index.html). Good luck!      \r\n\r\n### Chapter Two: Vocabulary Part 1\r\n* **Variables**: “nickname”, lowercase words/nouns (letters, digits and underscores)\r\n* **Numbers**: integers or floats (decimals, scientific notation) - underscores okay commas are not\r\n* **Strings**: any sort of characters (letters, digits, punctuation) surrounded by quotes (single and double)\r\n* **: Symbols**: look like variables but start with a colon, lightweight strings that usually aren’t printed to the screen\r\n* **Constants**: capitalized like proper nouns, can’t be changed once they are set\r\n* **. Methods**: verbs, attached to end of variables/constants by a dot, kernel methods do not use dots and are very common like print\r\n* **Method arguments**: if method requires more info- attached to end of method surrounded by parentheses (boat pulling an inner tube) and separated by commas; the inner tubes can be chained (empty inner tube? parenthesis can be dropped)\r\n* **:: Class methods**: double colon instead of dot to attach\r\n* **$ Global variables**: begin with dollar sign, guarantees the variable is the same in every “house”, can be used anywhere in the program\r\n* **@ Instance variables**: begin with at symbol, often used to define attributes of something (@width)\r\n* **@@ Class variables**: define an attribute to many related objects (instance variable sets width for the front_door while class variables set width for everything that is a Door) “attribute all”\r\n* **{} Block**: crab pincers snatching code up and holding it together- used to group a set of instructions together so that they can be passed around in the program (or can use do and end)\r\n* **|| Block arguments**: tunnel/chute (between blocks and outside world) at the beginning of the block through which variables are passed in\r\n* **() Ranges**: two values surrounded by parentheses and separated by an ellipsis (1..3)- numbers one through three or (‘a’..'z’)- lowercase alphabet; like an accordion; three dots means that last value is excluded (0…5)- numbers zero through 4\r\n* **[] Arrays**: list surrounded by square brackets and separated by commas, stapled caterpillar, collection in a specific order\r\n* **{} Hashes**: dictionary surrounded by curly braces, words match definitions with arrows {’name’ => ‘Peter’}, separated by commas, easy to search through\r\n* **// Regular expressions**: used to find words or patterns in text, the slashes on each side are pins (reg-exp! once pins are in the book)\r\n* **Operators**: ** ! ~ * / % + - & << >> | ^ > >= < <= <=> || != =~ !~ && += -= == === .. ... not and or\r\n* **Keywords**: built-in words with imbedded meanings: \r\n    + alias   \r\n    + and     \r\n    + BEGIN   \r\n    + begin   \r\n    + break   \r\n    + case    \r\n    + class   \r\n    + def     \r\n    + defined\r\n    + do      \r\n    + else    \r\n    + elsif   \r\n    + END     \r\n    + end     \r\n    + ensure  \r\n    + false       \r\n    + for     \r\n    + if\r\n    + in      \r\n    + module  \r\n    + next    \r\n    + nil     \r\n    + not     \r\n    + or      \r\n    + redo    \r\n    + rescue  \r\n    + retry\r\n    + return  \r\n    + self    \r\n    + super   \r\n    + then    \r\n    + true    \r\n    + undef   \r\n    + unless  \r\n    + until   \r\n    + when\r\n    + while   \r\n    + yield\r\n* **Nil**: no value, not undefined but empty (plastic_cup = nil; if plastic_cup; print “hello”; end) <- will not print out anything\r\n* **False**: only other keyword with negative charade (also nil)\r\n* **Unless**: only allows those with a negative charge in (print “yay” if plastic_cup unless glass_cup) <- print only if a is true and b is false; if and unless can be stacked at the end of a single line of code; with if/unless only last full statement will be used if there are multiple lines of code\r\n* **==**: acts as an ID check, method but can drop the dot\r\n* **<< Concatenation operator**: add to the end method, answers with string, (address = @hotmail; address << (“.com”) ) <-@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n### Chapter Three: The Unrelated Chapter Where I Talk About Dyson\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
