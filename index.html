<p>If you are sorely disappointed by the disclaimer above, do not continue reading this guide. Instead, learn Ruby <a href="http://poignant.guide/">here</a>. Otherwise, welcome to my Ruby guide. This guide is not necessarily for you to learn Ruby, but a place for me to store and share the knowledge I gain on my own Ruby journey! I am not a Ruby expert (yet) but hang around and you can learn the language with me! </p>

<p>Remember your middle school Spanish class? </p>

<p>Every Friday, Ms. Jones totters about the room in her too-tight pantsuit, handing out a vocabulary quiz. She stops every couple rows to scrunch up her face in an attempt to keep a pair of oversized spectacles from falling off the bridge of her narrow pinched nose. The girl in the back jumps up a few rows to sit as close as possible to Tommy Jean. Casey, in a deep blue tee with a fire breathing dragon plastered across the front, squirms uneasily and tries to discreetly unlodge something from his left nostril. Kim pops her gum and tosses her hair nonchalantly, pulling out a folded square of paper. Down the hall in gym class, Trisha, who seriously owes Kim and took this same quiz first period, starts sweating profusely (obviously not from the game of dodgeball because she is so not participating). She knows that if a single answer on that paper is wrong, she is so uninvited from Kim's 13th birthday party which would so kill her social reputation, but more importantly would totally destroy her chances with Kim's dreamy older brother Chris. </p>

<p>Alright, let's make one thing clear right now. This Ruby guide will <em>not</em> be like middle school Spanish. Yes, you will have to learn vocabulary. And no, you cannot cheat off of Tommy Jean. But I am not Ms. Jones; I do not wear pantsuits and I will not take attendance or give you Friday quizzes. If you want to an "A" in Ruby, you <em>will</em> need to learn the vocabulary, but you will also need to practice practice practice the "reading" and "writing" exercises found <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/index.html">here</a>. Good luck!      </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Variables</strong>: “nickname”, lowercase words/nouns (letters, digits and underscores)</li>
<li>
<strong>Numbers</strong>: integers or floats (decimals, scientific notation) - underscores okay commas are not</li>
<li>
<strong>Strings</strong>: any sort of characters (letters, digits, punctuation) surrounded by quotes (single and double)</li>
<li>
<strong>: Symbols</strong>: look like variables but start with a colon, lightweight strings that usually aren’t printed to the screen</li>
<li>
<strong>Constants</strong>: capitalized like proper nouns, can’t be changed once they are set</li>
<li>
<strong>. Methods</strong>: verbs, attached to end of variables/constants by a dot, kernel methods do not use dots and are very common like print</li>
<li>
<strong>Method arguments</strong>: if method requires more info- attached to end of method surrounded by parentheses (boat pulling an inner tube) and separated by commas; the inner tubes can be chained (empty inner tube? parenthesis can be dropped)</li>
<li>
<strong>:: Class methods</strong>: double colon instead of dot to attach</li>
<li>
<strong>$ Global variables</strong>: begin with dollar sign, guarantees the variable is the same in every “house”, can be used anywhere in the program</li>
<li>
<strong>@ Instance variables</strong>: begin with at symbol, often used to define attributes of something (<a href="https://github.com/width" class="user-mention">@width</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>@@ Class variables</strong>: define an attribute to many related objects (instance variable sets width for the front_door while class variables set width for everything that is a Door) “attribute all”</li>
<li>
<strong>{} Block</strong>: crab pincers snatching code up and holding it together- used to group a set of instructions together so that they can be passed around in the program (or can use do and end)</li>
<li>
<strong>|| Block arguments</strong>: tunnel/chute (between blocks and outside world) at the beginning of the block through which variables are passed in</li>
<li>
<strong>() Ranges</strong>: two values surrounded by parentheses and separated by an ellipsis (1..3)- numbers one through three or (‘a’..'z’)- lowercase alphabet; like an accordion; three dots means that last value is excluded (0…5)- numbers zero through 4</li>
<li>
<strong>[] Arrays</strong>: list surrounded by square brackets and separated by commas, stapled caterpillar, collection in a specific order
\nex.
\nrooms = ArrayMine[3, 4, 6] print "We have " + rooms.join( ", ", "%d bed" ) + " rooms available."
“We have 3 bed, 4 bed, and 6 bed rooms available."</li>
<li>
<strong>{} Hashes</strong>: dictionary surrounded by curly braces, words match definitions with arrows {’name’ =&gt; ‘Peter’}, separated by commas, easy to search through</li>
<li>
<strong>// Regular expressions</strong>: used to find words or patterns in text, the slashes on each side are pins (reg-exp! once pins are in the book)</li>
<li>
<strong>Operators</strong>: ** ! ~ * / % + - &amp; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; | ^ &gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;= &lt;=&gt; || != =~ !~ &amp;&amp; += -= == === .. ... not and or</li>
<li>
<strong>Keywords</strong>: built-in words with imbedded meanings:

</li>
<li>
<strong>Nil</strong>: no value, not undefined but empty (plastic_cup = nil; if plastic_cup; print “hello”; end) &lt;- will not print out anything</li>
<li>
<strong>False</strong>: only other keyword with negative charade (also nil)</li>
<li>
<strong>Unless</strong>: only allows those with a negative charge in (print “yay” if plastic_cup unless glass_cup) &lt;- print only if a is true and b is false; if and unless can be stacked at the end of a single line of code; with if/unless only last full statement will be used if there are multiple lines of code</li>
<li>
<strong>==</strong>: acts as an ID check, method but can drop the dot</li>
<li>
<strong>&lt;&lt; Concatenation operator</strong>: add to the end method, answers with string, (address = hotmail; address &lt;&lt; (“.com”) ) &lt;-@hotmail.com

<a id="chapter-three" class="anchor" href="#chapter-three" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chapter Three: Vocabulary Intermission</h3>

<p>Wouldn't it be wonderful if once you learned a bit of information or acquired a skill, you would never forget it? Granted that is the case for some things like, "how to make a PB & J" or "what the word 'yes' means", but many other abilities and understandings escape us when we don't utilize them frequently enough. Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-n2-4UuknI">imagine</a>, you would still remember how to tie the life-saving knots you learned in Boy Scouts, and you'd never again experience the frustration of staring at a question on an exam thinking, "Come on! I know I studied this exact problem last night..."</p>

<p>You might have been tempted to roll your eyes just now, but don't worry, my lovely friend Matt stomped all over my utopian idea by saying, "Joi, that is so stupid. Sure people would know everything, but they wouldn't really <em>know</em> anything, ya know?"</p>

<a id="chapter-four" class="anchor" href="#chapter-four" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chapter Four: Vocabulary Part 2</h3>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  <strong>elsif</strong>: else if
\nex. print( if at_hotel.nil? "No clue if he's in the hotel." elsif at_hotel == true "Definitely in." elsif at_hotel == false "He's out." else "The system is on the freee-itz." end )
</li>
<li>
  <strong>{} Hash</strong>: word list, code words/phrases are matched with dangerous words 
\nex. CODE_WORDS = { 'catapult' => 'chucky go-go', 'firebomb' => 'Heat-Assisted Living’, 'Nigeria' => "Jerry's Dry Cleaning",}
key => value; ’Nigeria’ => “Jerry’s Dry Cleaning” or ’Nigeria’ => ‘Jerry/’s Dry Cleaning’ (single vs. double quotes); to look up a word use [], CODE_WORDS[ ‘catapult’ ] will answer with ‘chucky go-go’
</li>
<li>
  <strong># Comments</strong>: comment are comments... but as a side note gets, print and require_relative are all kernel methods</li>
<li>
  <strong>Destructive method</strong>: gsub! <- provide word to find and word to put in its place so idea.gsub!(real, code) replaces real with code in idea</li>
<li>
  <strong>strip</strong>: method for strings that trims spaces/blank lines from beginning and end of string</li>
<li>
  <strong>File mode</strong>: ‘w’ writes a brand-new file, ‘r’ reads form the file, ‘a’ adds to the end of the file
\nex. File::open( 'idea-' + idea_name + '.txt', 'w' ) do |f| f << idea end
when the block closes with end the file closes as well, << concatenator is used to write to the file</li>
<li>
  <strong>Searching a directory</strong>:
\nex. p Dir['idea-*.txt']
will print anything that starts with idea and ends in .txt</li>
<li>
  <strong>3 Arrays each with a Hash inside, all added into one big Array</strong>:
kitty_toys = [:shape => 'sock', :fabric => 'cashmere'] + [:shape => 'mouse', :fabric => 'calico'] + [:shape => 'eggroll', :fabric => 'chenille'] kitty_toys.sort_by { |toy| toy[:fabric] }
If you use arrows inside of an Array, you’ll end up with a Hash inside of that Array</li>
<li>
  <strong>3 Hashes in 1 Array</strong>:
kitty_toys = [ {:shape => 'sock', :fabric => 'cashmere'}, {:shape => 'mouse', :fabric => 'calico'}, {:shape => 'eggroll', :fabric => 'chenille'} ]
\nex. kitty_toys.sort_by { |toy| toy[:shape] }.each do |toy| puts "Blixy has a #{ toy[:shape] } made of #{ toy[:fabric] }" end</li>
<li><strong>next</strong>: skips on to the next item when iterating through a list
\nex. non_eggroll = 0 kitty_toys.each do |toy| next if toy[:shape] == 'eggroll' non_eggroll = non_eggroll + 1 end</li>
<li>
  <strong>break</strong>: kicks you out of an iterating loop
\nex. kitty_toys.each do |toy| break if toy[:fabric] == 'chenille' p toy end</li>
<li>
  <strong>===</strong>: like the double equals but sags in the middle, a bit more flexible, can be used with ranges (if double equals a range can only be equal to another range, but with triple a specific year can be equated to the range of years it falls into)</li>
<li>
  <strong>scope</strong>: refers to a field of vision inside methods and blocks</li>
<li>
  <strong>def</strong>: opens a method’s vision, global variables are available in any scope, instance variables are available inside a class scope (same with @@) </li>
<li>
  <strong>Scope of blocks</strong>: 
\nex. verb = 'rescued' ['sedated', 'sprinkled', 'electrocuted']. each do |verb| puts "Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah." end puts "Finally, Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."</li>
<li>
  <strong>rand()</strong>: picks a random number, @energy = rand(6) between 0 and 5, and assigns that number to an instance variable</li>
<li>
  <strong>respond.to?</strong>: checks any object to be sure that it has a certain method </li>
<li>
  <strong>dup</strong>: sentence = sentence.dup creates a copy of the sentence, numbers, special variables (nil, true, false) and symbols cannot be dup’d; gsub will automatically make a copy as it does its job</li>
</ul>
