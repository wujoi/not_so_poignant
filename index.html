<p>If you are sorely disappointed by the disclaimer above, do not continue reading this guide. Instead, learn Ruby <a href="http://poignant.guide/">here</a>. Otherwise, welcome to my Ruby guide. This guide is not necessarily for you to learn Ruby, but a place for me to store and share the knowledge I gain on my own Ruby journey! I am not a Ruby expert (yet) but hang around and you can learn the language with me! </p>

<p>Remember your middle school Spanish class? Every Friday, Ms. Jones totters about the room in her too-tight pantsuit, handing out a vocabulary quiz. She stops every couple rows to scrunch up her face in an attempt to keep a pair of oversized spectacles from falling off the bridge of her narrow pinched nose. The girl in the back jumps up a few rows to sit as close as possible to Tommy Jean. Casey, in a deep blue tee with a fire breathing dragon plastered across the front, squirms uneasily and tries to discreetly unlodge something from his left nostril. Kim pops her gum and tosses her hair nonchalantly, pulling out a folded square of paper. Down the hall in gym class, Trisha, who seriously owes Kim and took this same quiz first period, starts sweating profusely (obviously not from the game of dodgeball because she is so not participating). She knows that if a single answer on that paper is wrong, she is so uninvited from Kim's 13th birthday party which would so kill her social reputation, but more importantly would totally destroy her chances with Kim's dreamy older brother Chris. </p>

<p>Alright, let's make one thing clear right now. This Ruby guide will <em>not</em> be like middle school Spanish. Yes, you will have to learn vocabulary. And no, you cannot cheat off of Tommy Jean. But I am not Ms. Jones; I do not wear pantsuits and I will not take attendance or give you Friday quizzes. If you want to an "A" in Ruby, you <em>will</em> need to learn the vocabulary, but you will also need to practice practice practice the writing and reading exercises found <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/index.html">here</a>. Good luck!      </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
